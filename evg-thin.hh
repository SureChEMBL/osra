/**
   The thinning algorithm can be thought of as a "brush fire" where a
   fire starts at every obstacle and burns into freespace.  When two
   fronts of the fire meet, they define a skeleton.  
   
   This particular algorithm has special purpose machinery to crete a
   1 cell wide skeleton (stops a cell from "burning" if it is next to
   two or more "fronts" of the fire.
   
   I made a linear algorthim from the quadradic algorithm discussed in
   the original thinning publication (see README).

   I also added max and min parameters and a pruning operator to
   remove spurs.
