Description:

OSRA is a utility designed to convert graphical representations of
chemical structures, as they appear in journal articles, patent documents,
textbooks, trade magazines etc., into SMILES (Simplified Molecular
Input Line Entry Specification - see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMILES ) - 
a computer recognizable molecular structure format.  OSRA can read a document 
in any of the over 90 graphical formats parseable by ImageMagick - including 
GIF, JPEG, PNG, TIFF, PDF, PS etc., and generate the SMILES representation of
the molecular structure images encountered within that document.

Note that any software designed for optical recognition is unlikely to
be perfect, and the output produced might, and probably will, contain
errors, so a curation by a human knowledgeable in chemical structures 
is highly recommended.

Source code and pre-compiled binaries (compiled with MinGW suite for
Windows platform) are available from:

=============================================================================
Compilation:

Edit the included Makefile to make sure you have the correct locations
for ImageMagick, potrace, gocr, openbabel, and tclap.  Running make
should then generate the executable - osra.

For compiling with MinGW or Cygwin environment see more detailed
instructions at the end of this file.
=============================================================================
Usage:

OSRA can process the following types of images:

- Computer-generated 2D structures, such as found on the PubChem website,
http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/, black-and-white and color (use a
resolution of 72 dpi),

- Black-and-white PDF and PostScript files, including multi-page ones. Please
note that you need Ghostcript installed for ImageMagick to be able to
parse these kinds of files. OSRA internally renders PS and PDF at a resolution 
of 150 dpi, so you do not need to specify the resolution as a commmand-line parameter,

- Scanned images - black-and-white, a resolution of 300 dpi is recommended,
though 150 dpi can also produce fair results. Please make sure the
scanned image is of reasonable quality - an input that's too noisy will 
only generate garbage output.

Some common abbreviations, hetero atoms, fused and merged atomic
labels, hash and wedge bonds, and bridge bonds are currently
recognized. Formal charges, isotopes and some element
symbols, i.e. iodine ("I" -- looks too much like a straight line = single
bond), are not.


Command-line options: 
./osra --help 
will give you a list of available options with short descriptions.

Most common use: ./osra [-r <resolution>] <filename>

Resolution in dpi, default is 300 (unless it's a PS or PDF file as
mentioned above), filename is the name of your image file (or
PS/PDF document).

Other options: 
-t, --threshold: Gray level threshold, default is 0.2
                 for black-and-white images, 

-n, --negate:    Inverts colors (for white on black images),

-o, --output:    Sets a prefix for writing recognized images to files - i.e.
                 "-o tmp" will create files tmp0.png, tmp1.png... for
                 each of the structures,

-s, --size:      Resize images on output - can be useful for running OSRA
                 as a backend for a webservice. Example: "-s 300x400".

Windows users:
You can download and use the zip archive with the pre-compiled binary.
The archive includes:
	osra.bat - Windows batch file, sets the environment and calls
	           osra.exe, 
	osra.exe - main executable. It is recommended that you use osra.bat
		   and not osra.exe directly,
	README   - this file,
        delegates.xml - a configuration file for ImageMagick library,
        Read Image Document (OSRA).xml - a simple Scitegic Pipeline Pilot
	                                 component to read in an image
					 document using OSRA.
To use: 
Make sure you have installed Ghostscript (32-bit executable) and edit if
necessary osra.bat to have the correct PATH (by default it points to version
8.61). Run osra.bat with the same options as described above for the Linux
version. You can also run OSRA through Pipiline Pilot by using the included
protocol. It runs osra.bat on the client by default but it's trivial to
modify the component for "Run on Server" option.

====================================================================
Compiling OSRA on Windows systems:

It is possible to compile OSRA using either Cygwin or MinGW environment,
however it appears that Cygwin-compiled executable runs about two orders of
magnitude slower than a Linux version running on an equivalent class CPU.
Therefore it is strongly recommended NOT to use Cygwin to compile OSRA.

The instructions below are for MinGW environment.

Before you compile ImageMagick it is necessary to install the pre-requisite
libraries - zlib, bzip2, jasper (I was able to compile only version 1.701.0
and not the later 1.900.1), jbigkit, jpeg-6b, lcms, libpng, tiff.
You can read "ADD-ON LIBRARIES & PROGRAMS" for GraphicsMagick which
seems to apply to ImageMagick as well: http://www.graphicsmagick.org/www/README.html

Whenever "configure" script was available I used the following options:
./configure --disable-shared LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include

Compile and install ImageMagick, GOCR, Potrace, TCLAP.

To compile OpenBabel first edit obmolecformat.h to comment out lines
involving hash_map, as per instructions here:
http://www.bioinformatics.org/molekel/wiki/Main/OpenBabel

Run configure, make, make install. Compilation breaks at some point but not
before generating libopenbabel.a which is what we need. Check that
src/formats/obmolecformat.o and src/formats/cansmilesformat.o have also been
generated. If for some reason the latter is not present you can compile it with
the following commands:
cd src/formats/
g++ -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I../../src -I../../include -I../../data -I../../include -g -O2 -MT cansmilesformat.lo -MD -MP -MF .deps/cansmilesformat.Tpo -c cansmilesformat.cpp -o cansmilesformat.o

To have OpenMP support:
Install gcc and g++ 4.2 or later and pthreads-win32 libraries.
Edit libgomp.spec to read:
*Link_gomp: -lgomp -lpthread

Copy include files from pthreads-win32 to /mingw/include
Copy libpthreadGC2.a to /mingw/lib/libpthread.a
Copy pthreadGC2.dll to the same directory as osra.exe

Compiling osra:
Edit the Makefile to comment out X11LIBS, choose the IMLIBS line containing
gdi32 and OPENBABELLIB line containing cansmilesformat.o and
obmolecformat.o, remove "-lnetpbm" from GOCRLIB. 
Running make should (hopefully) generate osra.exe. You're done!
Make sure you take a look at osra.bat to see that the environment is set
correctly. You will still need delegates.xml from ImageMagick installation
and a separately installed Ghostscript if you'd like to process PDF and
PostScript files.

===============================================================
Known bugs:

- Some PDF files cause the program to crash. As a workaround you can
try to first convert such problematic files to PostScript by using pdf2ps from
Ghostscript installation or some other utility.
